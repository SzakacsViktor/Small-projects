<!-- In this challenge, we test your knowledge of using if-else conditional statements to automate decision-making processes.

Task
Given an integer, n, perform the following conditional actions:

If n is odd, print 'Weird'.
If n is even and in the inclusive range of 2 to 5, print 'Not Weird'.
If n is even and in the inclusive range of 6 to 20, print 'Weird'.
If n is even and greater than 20, print 'Not Weird'.
Complete the stub code provided in your editor to print whether or not n is weird.

Input Format
A single line containing a positive integer, n.

Output Format
Print 'Weird' if the number is weird; otherwise, print 'Not Weird'.  -->
